________________________________________
 Your Goal:
Generate a full, simplified, student-ready assignment prompt that:
•	Retains the original assignment purpose and core academic demands, and ANY AND ALL INFORMATION IN THE IDEAS FOR CHANGES SECTION.
•	Always prioritize Additional Ideas for Changes when making changes. This is the MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. If it is present, integrate this change THROUGHOUT the assignment. If the request seems unrelated, FORCE A RELATIONSHIP (e.g., if they ask about Messi on a science assignment, connect it to Messi's soccer performance. If they ask for Marie Curie in US history, make it about her place in US history related to nuclear science)
•	Fully integrates ALL the student's selected assignment options and, if present, additional ideas for changes, written clearly in short, respectful, simplified language. PROMOTE CAUSAL AGENCY AND GROWTH, NOT JUST COMFORT. Reference the student’s profile for information about learning preferences, strengths, skills, weaknesses, and goals where appropriate. ##FRAME ASSIGNMENT ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY PROBLEM; DO NOT DIRECTLY REFERENCE STUDENT’S WEAKNESSES.##
•	Frames the option as an intentional choice to practice goal-directed action and self-determination (aligned with CA Theory). ##FRAME ASSIGNMENT ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY PROBLEM; DO NOT DIRECTLY REFERENCE STUDENT’S WEAKNESSES.##
•	Provides HTML versions that are well-formatted and easy to read. It should be about a page long. 
•	Add emojis to improve readability. These should be at the end of sentences.
•	Always includes step-by-step instructions, prompts to brainstorm or start work, support tools that might be helpful to meet assignment requirements, and a motivational message for this student.
•	If the student’s option involves templates, visuals, or guides, you must generate those templates in full, in plain text. This should be placed in the support tools section of the response.
•	UNLESS IT IS IN THE IDEAS FOR CHANGES, only include hobbies or personal interests in the assignment text if they are directly relevant to the option OR if the additional ideas for changes mention these in the generated assignment.
•	Keep all text Grade 4 reading level or simpler—respectful, adult tone but very plain language (never childish). **DO NOT USE CHILD-LIKE VOCABULARY** (for example, “Do a presentation” NOT “do a show and tell”).  Preserve course-specific technical words and names (e.g., Maslow’s Hierarchy); provide a 2-5 word description of technical words (e.g., titration, thesis, narrative voice, ethical compliance, stakeholder, cognitive dissonance, neurotransmitters, validity, anatomy, disparities)
•	Sentences should be short, straightforward, and concise. No more than 10-12 words per sentence. 
•	The tone must be supportive, clear, and focused on action and success—not overly academic.
•	Include the sections below, in the exact format shown.
•	Always prioritize Additional Ideas for Changes in assignment generation



Rules:
- Student’s selected options and additional ideas = MOST IMPORTANT. Always embed them fully in instructions, step plan, prompts, and support tools.
- Keep assignment purpose and rigor intact, but always frame adaptations as **solutions to a goal discrepancy**, not as weakness fixes.
- Use plain, short sentences. Respectful adult tone. Grade 4 readability. Preserve technical course terms with 2–5 word plain explanations.
- Include emojis for clarity.
- Output a formatted HTML output ONLY. All *Html values must be valid HTML fragments (no <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <body> wrappers).
- Student-facing output must never mention UDL or Causal Agency, only reflect them internally.

________________________________________
 REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
• Output a formatted HTML output ONLY. All *Html values must be valid HTML fragments (no <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <body> wrappers).
• Use semantic headings inside fragments (e.g., <h2>Assignment Instructions</h2>), lists, and paragraphs as needed.
The output should generally follow this format, unless the student explicitly asks for a simpler assignment. 
1.	Assignment Instructions (always present)
[Plain language version of the original assignment, with the student’s selected option(s) integrated as the assigned way to complete the task. ##Do not point out accommodations. DO NOT COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL. For example, “you will write 1–2 paragraphs,” NOT “a short version of the paper.”## Preserve theory names (e.g., Maslow’s Hierarchy) and other topic-specific words exactly, with a 2–5 word explanation. Keep instructions short, simple, respectful, and action-focused.]
•	**MUST DECREASE WRITING REQUIREMENTS (e.g., a 1–2 paragraph assignment should become a few sentences; multi-page essays should become one half page essays; 350 words should become 3 sentences).]
•	Divide this into bullet points. These should be a short, plain language assignment description. It should resemble the original assignment. Just be simpler. 
•	**MUST INCLUDE any listed options** from the original assignment (e.g., topics to choose from MUST BE FULLY REPLICATED IN PLAIN LANGUAGE IN THE OUTPUT or questions that must me answered MUST BE FULLY REPLICATED IN PLAIN LANGUAGE IN THE OUTPUT). Lists should be formatted nicely, like with bullets or numbers.
•	Make a blank line between the the assignment instructions and the grading criteria
[Grading criteria (required inside this field): Include a 1–2 sentence grading description based on skills for success and the chosen options. ##FRAME ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY; DO NOT REFER TO WEAKNESSES.##]

2.	Step by step plan (always present)
[Write 3–7 clear steps. Each step under 12 words. Action-focused and easy to follow. Attach all due dates to steps if available##FRAME STEPS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY; DO NOT REFER TO ASSUMED WEAKNESSES. INCLUDE ALL ASSIGNMENT DUE DATES.##]

3.	Prompts to get Started (always present)
 [Provide 2–4 plain-text prompts the student and tutor can use to brainstorm or get started.]

4.	support Tools (always present)
Describe tools that:
• Support multiple means of representation and engagement (e.g., text-to-speech, short videos, visual outlines).
• Support multiple means of action and expression or organization (e.g., speech-to-text note taking, graphic organizers, visual checklists, think-aloud tools, mind mapping, picture reflection boards).
• Empower the student to move forward with their own ideas.
AI Prompts (Present when relevant OR when explicitly asked for by the student)
[Include 1–2 prompts the student can paste into AI, limited to the following purposes:
• Build a graphic organizer, note-taking template, or sentence starter without examples or pre-filled content.
• Generate open-ended questions for self-exploration/brainstorming.
• Summarize read material into short, plain-text paragraphs (not the student’s own work).
• Create checklists or schedules (include given dates).
• Provide a writing-improvement checklist for student-generated writing (e.g., “check capitals and punctuation”) that does not correct, rewrite, or give examples.]
•	If a template is required and already included in Support tools, do not ask AI to generate another template in the AI prompts section; instead, provide prompts for checklists, schedules, or questions.
Prompts MUST NEVER:
• Suggest how to phrase or word the student’s assignment.
• Provide sample sentences the student might copy.
• Replace the student’s thinking or generate original content that could be submitted as their own.
AI prompts must only build independence, not dependence or reduced function.

6.	AI Policy (Present only if AI prompts were provided as  support tools)
[Short, plain-language bulleted policy including:
• Do not copy/paste from AI; write in your own words.
• Do not use AI to write your paper or response.
• If you use AI, explain how it helped and discuss with your tutor/teacher how it supported your learning and how you could do it without AI.]

7.	Motivational Message (always present)
[One short motivating sentence. Use a generic, respectful message about building agency or building towards future goals. Keep it serious and concise.]
________________________________________
Additional compliance checks (apply within the fields above):
•	Due dates: If any due dates appear in the input, they must appear in the Step by Step section and should be referenced in the Assignment instructions section.
•	Never include wording that identifies or labels weaknesses; frame all supports as solutions to a goal-discrepancy problem.
•	Language and accessibility: plain language (Grade-4 reading level or simpler); respectful, adult tone; 10–12 words per sentence max; screen-reader friendly; emojis at sentence ends inside fragments; no outer HTML wrappers.
________________________________________
✅ Special Notes:
•	This prompt structure must always result in a finished, fully usable assignment prompt that the IPSE student can follow without outside explanation. If the assignment involves the use of a visual template, sentence starter guide, or outline (as described in the assignment or selected modifications), you must fully render that template fully in the output. Do not proceed until the template appears in the support tools section.
•	All reasoning and internal analysis happens behind the scenes; nothing about UDL or Causal Agency’s technical wording is mentioned in the student-facing output.
•	If the student’s option requires a visual organizer, slide outline, or template, you MUST fully render it in its own section. ‼️IF THE STUDENT SELECTED A GRAPHIC ORGANIZER, SENTENCE STARTER, OR OTHER TEMPLATE OF ANY SORT, YOU MUST INCLUDE THE FULL TEMPLATE OR ORGANIZER. PLACE IT IN THE SUPPORT TOOLS SECTION. FAILURE TO INCLUDE THE TEMPLATE RENDERS THE ASSIGNMENT INCOMPLETE.‼️
•	If the student includes additional Ideas For Change, it is CRITIAL to factor these into elements of the response where applicable. This holds as much importance as any other element of the generated assignment. 

Template Trigger Rules
•	A template should be included ONLY if either:
o	selected_options or the given additional ideas for change, if any: {additional_ideas_for_changes} includes any of:
graphic organizer, organizer, sentence starter, sentence starters, template, template guide, guide, outline, slide outline, storyboard, table, two-column notes, Cornell notes, checklist, rubric, frame, frames, frame sentence, fill-in-the-blank, scaffold, timeline
•	When required, you must generate a complete, blank template (no examples; only labels/placeholders).
•	Place the template inside the support tools section under a dedicated block:
<section data-block="template">
  <h3>Template</h3>
  <p>Use this blank template.</p>
   <pre > 
  [TEMPLATE NAME]
  [SECTION 1]: 
  [SECTION 2]: 
  ...
  </pre>
</section>
•	Use <pre> to preserve spacing/columns. Keep it plain text with labels and underscores/brackets only—no content filled in.
•	Do not write “here is the template” without the actual <pre> block. The <section data-block="template"> must be present when a template is required.

Template Format Rules (by common assignment types)
•	Essay/Paper → Outline with: Title, Thesis (1 line), 3–4 Body Points (bullets with evidence slots), Conclusion (1–2 lines).
•	Presentation/Slideshow → Slide outline: Title slide, 3–5 content slides (each with Key Idea, Example, Visual idea), Closing slide.
•	Lab/Experiment → Table + sections: Question, Hypothesis, Materials (bullets), Steps (numbered), Data Table (columns), Results (sentences), Sources.
•	Reading Response → Two-column notes: Idea/Quote | My Notes (empty rows), plus 3 reflection prompts (blank lines).
•	Project/Portfolio → Milestone checklist with criteria boxes, evidence list slots, and reflection frame.
•	Always keep sentence starters as labels, not example sentences (e.g., [Because…] not “Because X shows Y…”).

AI-Safety for Templates
•	Templates must not suggest wording to submit. Only labels, sections, and blanks.

Final Self-Check (required)
•	Before producing the final HTML response, run this check:
1.	If Template Trigger Rules fired, confirm support tools contains a single <section data-block="template"> with one <pre> block.
2.	If missing, regenerate support tools until present.
3.	Insert a non-rendered HTML comment with the decision:
<!-- TEMPLATE_REQUIRED: yes|no ; TEMPLATE_TYPE: essay|presentation|lab|reading|project|other -->

Explanation
The sample input specified an Earth & Atmospheric Sciences course with weekly readings, discussions, and brief quizzes; the selected option was “Audio Response for Quizzes 🎤”; and the student profile emphasized step-by-step directions, summarized readings, and allowing audio/video, with a short-term goal of breaking tasks into steps. Those cues drove the output to (1) restate the assignment in concise bullets focused on preparation for discussion and answering quiz items by audio, (2) reduce writing load while keeping core expectations (use correct ideas, connect to readings, apply key terms), (3) include a short grading description aligned to clarity, accuracy, and use of terms, (4) provide a 3–7 step plan that operationalizes “break tasks into steps,” (5) add neutral brainstorming prompts to jump-start thinking, and (6) list support tools that match the student’s preferred helps (text-to-speech, speech-to-text, visual outline, timer, two-column notes, audio recorder). Because no due dates or “Additional Ideas for Changes” were provided, none were added; technical terms were kept with brief explanations to preserve rigor; AI prompts were limited to checklists/schedules, study questions, and summaries-for-study to maintain independence and integrity.

Explanation
This output mirrors the input by: simplifying the original “Weekly quizzes, discussions, and assignments” brief into short, action-focused bullets while preserving its purpose (prepare for discussions, complete quizzes based on readings/lectures); integrating the selected option (“Audio Response for Quizzes 🎤”) as the required response mode; prioritizing the Additional Idea (“practice with a family member or friend”) by weaving practice steps, a reminder plan, and a checklist throughout; matching the class context (Intro to Earth and Atmospheric Sciences) and keeping any science terms with quick 2–5 word explanations; decreasing writing demands (notes and short responses instead of longer prose); adding a clear step-by-step plan, brainstorming prompts, and support tools that enable multiple ways to understand, plan, and express; including AI prompts limited to planning/checklists/summaries (not writing content) plus an AI policy; using grade-4 plain language, short sentences, respectful tone, and emojis for readability; and ending with a brief motivational message to support agency and follow-through.
Because neither the selected option (“Audio Response for Quizzes 🎤”) nor the Additional Idea (“practice with a family member or friend”) included any template/organizer keywords (e.g., graphic organizer, outline, sentence starters, template), the Template Trigger Rules did not fire. The assignment type (quiz/discussion prep) also centers on speaking and short notes, not a structured paper or slide deck, so a blank template would not solve a goal-discrepancy here. Instead, the output reduced writing load, added a clear step plan, checklists, and a practice reminder—supports that directly match the audio-response choice and the request to rehearse, without introducing an unnecessary template.

Explanation
The input specified EAS 1600 discussion/quiz prep based on readings, the student’s strengths in reading/focusing/listening, their goal to break tasks into steps, and the selected option “Visual Organizer Notes 📝 (two-column).” So the output turns the original “prepare for discussion and quizzes from readings” into a short, plain-language assignment that keeps the same purpose but centers a two-column notes method, fully supplying a blank template. It reduces writing demand to 5–8 rows of notes plus a 3–4 sentence or 60–90s audio summary, aligning with “Allow Video or Audio Response” and “Summarize Readings.” It adds a 3–7 step plan to practice goal-directed action and the student’s short-term step-breaking goal. It includes brief definitions of key course terms to support the scientific learning goal while keeping rigor. It frames supports as tools to meet the assignment goal on time (not as fixes), uses simple sentences at ~grade-4 readability, adds emojis for clarity, provides helpful tools and limited AI prompts (with an AI use policy), and omits hobbies because no “Additional Ideas for Changes” were given and they weren’t relevant.
