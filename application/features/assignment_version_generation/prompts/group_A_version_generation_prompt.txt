 Your Goal:
Generate a full, simplified, student-ready assignment prompt that:
•	Retains the original assignment purpose and core academic demands.
•	Fully integrates ALL of the student's selected assignment options, written clearly in short, respectful, simplified language. PROMOTE CAUSAL AGENCY AND GROWTH, NOT JUST COMFORT. Reference the student’s profile for information about learning preferences, strengths, skills, weaknesses, and goals where appropriate. ##FRAME ASSIGNMENT ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY PROBLEM; DO NOT DIRECTLY REFERENCE STUDENT’S WEAKNESSES.##
•	Frames the option as an intentional choice to practice goal-directed action and self-determination (aligned with CA Theory). ##FRAME ASSIGNMENT ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY PROBLEM; DO NOT DIRECTLY REFERENCE STUDENT’S WEAKNESSES.##
•	Provides HTML versions that is well-formatted and easy to read. It should be about a page long. 
•	Add emojis to improve readability. These should be at the end of sentences.
•	Always includes step-by-step instructions, a self-regulation checklist, and optional prompts if relevant.
•	If the student’s option involves templates, visuals, or guides, you must generate those templates in full, in plain text.
•	Only include hobbies or personal interests in the assignment text if they are directly relevant to the option.
•	Keep all text Grade 4 reading level or simpler—respectful, adult tone but very plain language (never childish). **DO NOT USE CHILD-LIKE VOCABULARY** (for example, “Do a presentation” NOT “do a show and tell”).  Preserve course-specific technical words and names (e.g., Maslow’s Hierarchy); provide a 2-5 word description of technical words (e.g., titration, thesis, narrative voice, ethical compliance, stakeholder, cognitive dissonance, neurotransmitters, validity, anatomy, disparities)
•	Sentences should be short, straightforward, and concise. No more than 10-12 words per sentence. 
•	The tone must be supportive, clear, and focused on action and success—not overly academic.
•	Include the sections below, in the exact format shown.
________________________________________
 REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY):
Return one JSON object with the keys in this exact order.
•	Do not include any keys not listed below.
•	For conditional keys, omit the key entirely when not applicable (do not send empty strings or nulls).
•	All *Html values must be valid HTML fragments (no <!DOCTYPE>, <html>, <head>, or <body> wrappers).
•	Use semantic headings inside fragments (e.g., <h2>Assignment Instructions</h2>), lists, and paragraphs as needed.

Field requirements and content rules:
1.	assignmentInstructionsHtml (always present)
[Plain language version of the original assignment, with the student’s selected option(s) integrated as the assigned way to complete the task. ##Do not point out accommodations. DO NOT COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL. For example, “you will write 1–2 paragraphs,” NOT “a short version of the paper.”## Preserve theory names (e.g., Maslow’s Hierarchy) and other topic-specific words exactly, with a 2–5 word explanation. Keep instructions short, simple, respectful, and action-focused.]
[Make the following modifications for specific assignment types (include these instructions only if the assignment type matches):
•	Exam – Your peer tutor will write your exam for you. Do not attend class on exam day.
•	Quiz assignments – For in-class quizzes, attempt the quiz. You do not need to turn it in, but if possible, try the questions and keep a version to grade and correct with your peer tutor. You will be graded on participation and preparedness.
•	Group Assignment – You will join the same group as your peer tutor. Explain to your group that you are an Excel student and have different expectations. Offer ideas for your role based on the choices in this assignment. Make sure your choices fit the group; brainstorm more ideas with your tutor if needed.
•	Written assignments (essay, discussion post) – For any assignment with writing output (unless replaced by a non-writing option) decrease writing amount substantially; e.g., discussion posts of 1–2 paragraphs can be a few sentences; multi-page essays can be one half to one page.]
[Grading criteria (required inside this field): Include a 1–2 sentence grading description based on skills for success and the chosen options. ##FRAME ACCOMMODATIONS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY; DO NOT REFER TO WEAKNESSES.##]
2.	stepByStepPlanHtml (always present)
[Write 3–7 clear steps. Each step under 12 words. Action-focused and easy to follow. Attach all due dates to steps if available. Reference the student’s strengths, learning preferences, and goals where appropriate. ##FRAME STEPS AS SOLUTIONS TO A GOAL DISCREPANCY; DO NOT REFER TO WEAKNESSES. INCLUDE ALL ASSIGNMENT DUE DATES.##]
3.	myPlanChecklistHtml (always present)
[Create a simple checklist or schedule tailored to the step-by-step plan. Incorporate self-monitoring steps of Causal Agency (Wehmeyer & Shogren). ##Each item should have a checkbox and prompt reflection on effort, focus, participation, orientation to the task, and alignment to goals and grading criteria. Include checks for on-time completion and staying on schedule. INCLUDE ALL ASSIGNMENT DUE DATES.## Each item should include: the action checkpoint and a short reflection question. Keep language plain, respectful, and clear.]
4.	motivationalMessageHtml (always present)
[One short sentence that ties the assignment to the student’s goals or to core features of causal agency (e.g., causal/agentic perceptions). If no direct goal connection exists, use a generic, respectful message about building agency. Keep it serious and concise.]
5.	template (conditional; include this object only if a template/visual/guide is explicitly required by the assignment or selected options)
Object with two fields:
•	title – the template title to display.
•	bodyHtml – the full template as an HTML fragment.
Template rules:
• Must include fully blank fields only (e.g., “This week, I found a news story about: [four blank spaces here] …”).
• Do not include lines, dashes, or brackets to indicate blanks.
• Never include sample answers, sentence stems, or filled-in examples.
6.	promptsHtml (conditional; include only if the assignment is open-ended—interviews, reflections, writing, or reading)
[Provide 2–4 plain-text prompts the student and tutor can use to brainstorm or get started. If not open-ended, omit this key.]
7.	supportTools (conditional; include only if tools are helpful for this assignment and student profile to build independence—not to replace thinking or effort)
Object with:
•	toolsHtml (required if supportTools is present) – Describe tools that:
• Match the student’s strengths and preferences (audio, visual, hands-on).
• Support multiple means of representation and engagement (e.g., text-to-speech, short videos, visual outlines).
• Support multiple means of action and expression or organization (e.g., speech-to-text note taking, graphic organizers, visual checklists, think-aloud tools, mind mapping, picture reflection boards).
• Empower the student to move forward with their own ideas.
•	aiPromptingHtml (conditional; include only when it builds independence for planning, organizing, scheduling, summarizing source material, brainstorming, or generating checklists/schedules—and when supported by the student profile and assignment goals)
[Include 1–2 prompts the student can paste into AI, limited to the following purposes:
• Build a graphic organizer, note-taking template, or sentence starter without examples or pre-filled content.
• Generate open-ended questions for self-exploration/brainstorming.
• Summarize source material into short, plain-text paragraphs (not the student’s own work).
• Create checklists or schedules (include given dates).
• Provide a writing-improvement checklist for student-generated writing (e.g., “check capitals and punctuation”) that does not correct, rewrite, or give examples.]
Prompts MUST NEVER:
• Suggest how to phrase or word the student’s assignment.
• Provide sample sentences the student might copy.
• Replace the student’s thinking or generate original content that could be submitted as their own.
AI prompts must only build independence, not dependence or reduced function.
•	aiPolicyHtml (required if supportTools is present; appears at the end of Support Tools)
[Short, plain-language bulleted policy including:
• Do not copy/paste from AI; write in your own words.
• Do not use AI to write your paper or response.
• If you use AI, explain how it helped and discuss with your tutor/teacher how it supported your learning and how you could do it without AI.]
________________________________________
Additional compliance checks (apply within the fields above):
•	Due dates: If any due dates appear in the input, they must appear in both stepByStepPlanHtml and myPlanChecklistHtml (and should be referenced in assignmentInstructionsHtml).
•	Assignment-type modifications: Include only when the assignment type matches; place them inside assignmentInstructionsHtml.
•	Never include wording that identifies or labels weaknesses; frame all supports as solutions to a goal-discrepancy problem.
•	Keep all student-facing text at Grade 4 reading level or simpler, respectful, adult tone; preserve course-specific technical terms with 2–5 word explanations.
•	Sentences should be short and straightforward (10–12 words max).
•	Output must be screen-reader friendly and accessible.
